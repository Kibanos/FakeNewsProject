# 3 python files were made written.
~Dump.py is just where tidbits of code that were changed up were placed in case backtracking versions were required
~MLSelection.py uses the baseline files to simply pick a Machine Learner
# OwnExtraction.py contains the entire task problem implemented from scratch 
		
		(i.e. it contains self designed data collation, feature extraction, and machine learning approach)
		The reason why even the data collation was re done was because the way it was set up in the baseline
		made it unable to do stratified folding for validating the ML
		
		This is however slow due to the new features integrated and used
		and as no pkl files were made during initial run it can't be fast tracked
		However it did complete a run a before the system crashed so the code function correctly
    (Provided there is sufficient RAM/processing speed)
